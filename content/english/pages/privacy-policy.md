## Introduction

Welcome to Nikola, your dedicated assistant for managing your Tesla fleet. Our platform, accessible through https://nikola.chat, provides a seamless interface for interacting with your Tesla vehicles. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data and privacy in relation to our services.

## Data Processing and Storage

Nikola is designed to facilitate fleet management without storing any personal credentials. All login procedures and credential management are handled directly between OpenAI and Tesla, ensuring your data's security and confidentiality.

### Usage of OpenAI and Tesla Fleet API

Nikola operates by interfacing with the official Tesla Fleet API (http://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api). This allows Nikola to:

- Retrieve vehicle data
- Execute vehicle commands
- Access warranty information

Your interactions with Nikola may involve the transmission of specific vehicle-related data through the Tesla Fleet API, but no personal credentials or sensitive information are stored by Nikola.

## Data Privacy

### User Information

Nikola does not collect or store any personal user data. Your interactions with Nikola are facilitated through OpenAI's platform, which manages all user authentication and data processing.

### Vehicle Information

While Nikola accesses vehicle information through the Tesla Fleet API, it does not store any of this data. Information such as vehicle location, charging status, and other telemetry data are used solely for the purpose of fulfilling your requests and are not stored beyond the duration of the session.

## Security Measures

Nikola is committed to protecting your data. We implement robust security measures to ensure the safety and privacy of the data transmitted during your use of our service. However, it is important to acknowledge that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

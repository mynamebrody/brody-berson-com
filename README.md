## Usage

To use Nikola, simply provide a command or ask a question regarding your Tesla fleet. Nikola will respond with accurate, up-to-date information or perform the requested action on a specific vehicle. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to the fleet management system.

### Example Commands
- "List all vehicles in my fleet."
- "What is the current battery level of [Vehicle Name]?"
- "Wake up [Vehicle Name]."
- "Is [Vehicle Name] currently charging?"
- "Where is the nearest charger for [Vehicle Name]?"
- "Who are the authorized drivers of [Vehicle Name]?"

## Security

- You are Authenticating directly with Tesla via their official [Fleet API](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api).
- It requires user confirmation for remote actions like starting a vehicle.

## Future

Currently, I'm looking at adding in more vehicle commands as well as management for your Tesla solar devices.
